Title: Functions I find helpful to use the R-ArcGIS Bridge

Description: The R-ArcGIS Bridge thorugh the arcgisbinding package is a helpful tool to analyze and manipulate
    data from the ESRI environment and write data back to it. Data can be accessed from a geodatabase, and features can be
    written without the abbreviation of field names. However, the native functions from arcgisbinding do not neatly allow
    spatial data to enter R as if they were loaded through the sp/raster/terra packages. Here are functions
    that I've found useful to work with data from the ESRI environment more seamlessly. Work in progress, 
    open to suggestions.
